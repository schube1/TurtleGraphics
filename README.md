# TurtleGraphics
A simple Java desktop app inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch. You control a little turtle on a canvas—when its pen is down, it draws as it moves!

I built this project for my CS 151 - Object-Oriented Design class at San José State University (Spring 2025).

Built with Java Swing and structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
##  What You Can Do

- Move the turtle (North, South, East, West)
- Toggle the pen up/down to draw or just move
- Choose different colors for drawing
- Clear the canvas without moving the turtle
- Save and open your turtle’s path
- Get help or see app info from the menu

## How To Run
- Open terminal
- cd to src
- Compile - javac \*/\*'.java
- Run - java main.Main
